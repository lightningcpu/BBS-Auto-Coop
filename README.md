If you want to use this script, first you want to set it up.

There is a YouTube video in the link.txt file.

You want to make the game window size exactly 1024x576.

You need to run Setup.bat to setup and download all needed libraries.

You have the option to either run using .exe or .py. Choose whatever is more comfortable.

Note: This script might be a bit outdated, I have written it back in 2023.
